                FIL Austin is an epic decentralized event organized by the community, for the community.

              So, a decentralized event is a set of events?
            </Accordion.Title>

              <p className="mb-2 text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400">
                That's correct! Instead of organizing a single event, FIL Austin follows a decentralied event format,
                which enables lots of groups to organize their own events surrounding FIL Austin.
