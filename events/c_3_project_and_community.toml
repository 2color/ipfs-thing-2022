description = """

This track aims to create space for advancing the IPFS project and community. New session proposals are welcome, especially those that focus on a specific, actionable subtopic rather than attempting to grapple with project and community stewardship.

Currently, we have reserved a 1/2 day for this track. If enough sessions are proposed, this track will be extended into Friday afternoon.

description="This session will be a walk through how PL manages IPFS GitHub organization configuration as code using a tool called GitHub Management. It'll provide practical information on how to request changes to the configuration (for example, if you contribute frequently to a repository within IPFS and you'd want to become a collaborator) and how to set up a similar solution in any other GitHub organization."

title="Reorienting the website"
description="IPFS's public presence predominantly communicates that there are 2 IPFS implementations, js-ipfs and go-ipfs. It also communicates that the project is essentially PL-owned. During this session, we will re-orient some key landing pages toward today's Cambrian explosion of new implementations. This is intended to a fairly surgical co-working session, with a short discussion to kick off and then each participant creating PRs."
