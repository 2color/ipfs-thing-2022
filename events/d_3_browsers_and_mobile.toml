**The goal of this track is to draft a document for reading and writing IPFS content from a Browser and/or Mobile application.**

Web Browers and Mobile Applications are both resource-constrained platforms with very short uptimes. They require us to reinterpret how IPFS should perform at the edge, and at the same time, represent a massive category of use.

This track is structured as an _intense_ half-day workshop. It will start with a brief introduction to frame our work, we'll hear lightning talks on use cases, then move to group discussion, using a design document for group iteration.
