[faq]

"What is FIL Austin?" = """
FIL Austin is an epic decentralized event organized by the community, for the community.
"""

"So, a decentralized event is a set of events?" = """
That's correct! Instead of organizing a single event, FIL Austin follows a decentralied event format,
which enables lots of groups to organize their own events surrounding FIL Austin.

We were inspired by [https://devconnect.org](DevConnect).
"""

"Do I need to buy tickets?" = """
Each event is ticketed separately. Some don't require tickets.
Be sure to check the event's website!
"""

"How do I contact the organizers?" = """
You can reach out to us at _____@fil.org.
