"What is IPFS Camp?" = """
  IPFS Camp is an epic decentralized event organized by the community, for the community.
"""

"So, a decentralized event is a set of events?" = """
  That's correct! Instead of organizing a single event, IPFS Camp follows a decentralied event format,
  which enables lots of groups to organize their own events surrounding IPFS Camp.

  We were inspired by [https://devconnect.org](DevConnect).
"""

"Do I need to buy tickets?" = """
  Each event is ticketed separately. Some don't require tickets.
  Be sure to check the event's website for ticket information!
"""

"How do I contact the organizers?" = """
